# Memory Game Project
The goal of this game is to match all 16 cards to win. You are scored with 1-3 stars based on how many moves you make to complete the game. When you complete the game, a modal will appear showing your score and time. This game requires internet connection to load the icons such as the card icons, stars, and reset button.
